# MacroManager addon
Tested on Classic WOTLK but should work on retail.

Type `/mm` or `/macromanager` to open the UI.

Built by `Grrumpy <Coldblooded> - Faerlina (US)`

### Features
- Uses the built-in macro system and your existing macros.
- Clean and streamlined UI.
- Easily move macros between account and character specific.
- Share macros in chat like you share WeakAuras.
